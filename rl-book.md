## The Reinforcement Learning Problem
### Reinforcement Learning
These three characteristics— being closed-loop in an essential way, not having direct instructions as to what actions to take, and where the consequences of actions, including reward signals, play out over extended time periods—are the three most important distinguishing features of the reinforcement learning problem.

Another key feature of reinforcement learning is that it explicitly considers the whole problem of a goal-directed agent interacting with an uncertain environment.

### Elements of Reinforcement Learning
Beyond the agent and the environment, one can identify four main subelements of a reinforcement learning system:
* a policy
* a reward signal
* a value function

and, optionally
* a model of the environment.

### Limitations and Scope
### An Extended Example: Tic-Tac-Toe
